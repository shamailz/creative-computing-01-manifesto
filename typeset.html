                The internet should be ours. It should be ours despite our differences. Internet access should not be based on where you live or what race you are or what your income is. The internet is our internet. It is not a negotiable want. With all the technology that is around us and how it has shaped our life and is integrated in society. It is a need. The internet is a need. Internet access should be given to all and that should not be something that has to be asked.
